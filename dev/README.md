# Dev tools

These are programs and tools used by jarconfig to enable more functionality, or to ease development.

# Install programs

7z.exe and wget.exe are used by the batch files to update and reinstall. Linux has equivalent programs natively installed, so it does not require these .exe's.

# Mtp

The mtp folder contains bash and python scripts to update and maintain mtp.cfg.

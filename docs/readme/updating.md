# Updating & Reseting

Batch and shell files are included that make updating and reseting easy. As a warning, these files should not be moved outside of their default location.

## update_from_github.bat/.sh

This redownloads everything from github, keeping only custom.cfg.

## reset_custom.bat/.sh

This redownloads custom.cfg and replaces it. This is for when you would like to return custom.cfg to its original form. Note that running this when being a few updates too old can cause issues, and it's recommended to update along with this.

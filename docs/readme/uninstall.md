# Uninstalling

Uninstalling can be done by simply deleting the jarconfig folder. That said it might be better to backup certain files.

## Files of note

Custom.cfg and the class cfg's store the player's settings. It can be useful to keep them so that you can transfer them outside of jarconfig and make transfering easier.
